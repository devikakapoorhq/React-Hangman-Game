# HangMan Game 
A classic Hangman game built with React, TypeScript, and Vite!
This project demonstrates my skills in modern frontend development, component-based architecture, and clean software engineering practices.

ðŸš€ Features
# Interactive Hangman game logic

Built with fast and modern tech: Vite + React + TypeScript

Scalable folder structure for easy maintenance

# Tech Stack
React (with functional components & hooks)

TypeScript (for type safety and cleaner code)

Vite (for lightning-fast development and builds)

CSS Modules (for scoped and maintainable styles)

ESLint and Prettier (for clean, formatted code)

# How It Works
The app randomly selects a word from a pre-defined list.

Players guess letters by clicking on a virtual keyboard.

Incorrect guesses trigger parts of the Hangman drawing.

The game ends when the player correctly guesses the word or completes the Hangman.

All the logic is broken down into clean, reusable React components, following single responsibility principle and modular design.
